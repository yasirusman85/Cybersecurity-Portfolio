# Botium Toys Cybersecurity Controls and Compliance 

## Project Introduction

This cybersecurity portfolio presents an in-depth analysis of Botium Toys' controls and compliance measures. The project assesses the current state of security controls in place, examines compliance with industry standards, and provides recommendations for enhancing the organization's security posture.

## Modeling and Evaluation

The assessment covers administrative/managerial controls, technical controls, and physical/operational controls, along with their corresponding control types. It also evaluates the risk assessment, compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2).

## Conclusion

Based on the assessment, it is clear that Botium Toys faces certain security challenges and compliance gaps. The risk score is relatively high, primarily due to the lack of controls and adherence to best practices. To improve the security posture, it is recommended to implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), strengthen the password policy, enforce a centralized password management system, and implement encryption for sensitive data. These steps will help mitigate risks and enhance data protection. Future steps include ongoing monitoring, regular maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems. By following these recommendations, Botium Toys can significantly improve its security and compliance.
